# Failure

Should you be unable to complete a task, because:
- you do not understand the users request or the task is unclear/incomplete;
- the task is logically impossible or contradictory;
- the task is beyond the capabilities of the tools you have access to; or
- you are unable to make meaningful progress
you must use the `return_agent_error` tool.
