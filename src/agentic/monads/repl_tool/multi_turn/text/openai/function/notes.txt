Notes:

- Always consider{% if has_global_resources %} the provided inputs, resources, and{% endif %} the signature of {{function_name}} before reasoning or coding.
- Use code-based inspection and incremental investigation
{% if is_returning_text %}
- The first response without a code block will be returned to the {{ include('/tags/instructions.txt') }} user
- To output the result of {{function_name}}, either
  - output a single response with text content only (no code block)
  - execute `return VALUE`, where VALUE is a Python string
{% else %}
- To output the result of {{function_name}} in a single code block that contains a `return` statement.
{% endif %}
- Do not deviate from the workflow or use non-specified modules. Only use available modules.
- If instructions are not solvable, raise an `AgentError` in code, wrapping an exception with a detailed reason.
- Always consider all pre-defined objects before outputting the result
